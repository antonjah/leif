Leif is a really stupid Go bot for Slack

## Requirements

In order for Leif to run you need to:

1. Create a Slack [bot user](https://api.slack.com/bot-users#creating-bot-user).  
2. Then generate an OAuth2 bot token from the [apps page](https://api.slack.com/apps).  
The actual token can then be found under the Your Apps page if you click on the name of your created bot and then go to the `OAuth & Permissions` page and then `Bot User OAuth Access Token`.  
The token should start with xoxb-*.

## Running Leif

Make sure you have the generated tokens from the [requirements](#requirements) step and run:

```bash
docker run -e SLACK_TOKEN=<slack-token> antonjah/leif
```
